#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
rails/.*
rails/.bundle

# Ignore all environment files (except templates).
rails/.env*
rails!/.env*.erb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
rails/log
rails/log/*
rails/tmp/*
rails!/log/.keep
rails!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
rails/tmp/pids/*
rails!/tmp/pids/
rails!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
rails/storage/*
rails!/storage/.keep
rails/tmp/storage/*
rails!/tmp/storage/
rails!/tmp/storage/.keep
